# PriceMusicApp

[Visit the website here](https://pricemusic.vercel.app/)

This website was designed as part of my friend's school project back in April 2023. The project was oriented around how music could affect one's moods and how different music with different rhythms can have various impacts. My friend created the playlists (now deleted, unfortunately) based on her research about music and I created the website as a portal for the project as the project required a "product". 

## How it works

The website uses a text input field, where you type in anything about your day. The website then uses a modified mood detection algorithm to detect what mood is the text related to the closest, then displays a Spotify playlist for that mood (created by my friend).
